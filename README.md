# BlackJack

Blackjack is basically a card game where you are dealt two cards, one face down, and one face up to start out with. You decide at that point by counting the amount of the value of the card if you would like another card (hit) to get as close to 21 as you can.

To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:
    Create a deck of 52 cards
    Shuffle the deck
    Ask the Player for their bet
    Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
    Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
    Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
    Show both of the Player's cards
    Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
    If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
    If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
    Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
    Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
    
Enjoy Playing!
